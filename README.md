A tool to discover where a chef attribute is being set from.

# Description
At some point or another when working with chef you'll end up in a situation
where it's necessary to unravel how or why a particular attribute is set on a
node a certain way. At which point you'll find yourself on a journey through
comparing the [15 levels of chef
attributes](https://docs.chef.io/attributes.html#attribute-precedence) 
and a nodes runlist - a painful
waste of time.
[debug_value](http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2014/09/02/chef-node-dot-debug-value/) can help by telling you roughly at what level 
it's being set at, but it's usefulness stops there.

Enter the chef-attribute-debugger. By simply instrumenting an example host in 
question's client.rb file, one can find the source of where an attribute is
being set.

# What it is
A series of monkey patches __for omnibus chef version 11.18.12__ that get applied 
at the client.rb level that can  determine from where an attribute is being 
set. By monkey patchincg all of the points in chef code that ingest attributes
 and piggy backing on the existing attribute precedence system.

 Methods involving the setting of attributes are wrapped using class\_eval to
 intercept the attribute and check if it's the one we're looking for. If it
 finds the one we're looking for it sets a new attribute
 'attribute\_debug\_location' to the value of where it was being set from to
 the best of it's knowledge. Since the setting of the new attribuete happens
 at the same precedence level it's safe to do this over and over again. This
 way the location will match up with the one that it actually evaluated to.

# What it isn't
a knife plugin, chef handler, etc.

# How to use it
* add the contents of client.rb in this repository to the top of a hosts
[client.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgedarovich/chef-attribute-debug/master/client.rb). 
* edit the 'attribut to debug' line at the top to reflect the attribute you 
want to determine the source of. 
* run chef on the host
```
sudo chef-client --once
```
* use knife to show the value of attribute\_debug\_location
```
knife node show HOSTNAME_HERE -a attribute_debug_location
```

# Running tests
requirements: docker, kitchen, maybe some kitchen docker plugin

```
kitchen test
```
the tests are setup like an onion, where each consecutive test case sets the
test attribute at the next highest level of precedence.

```
each test case number corresponds to a precedence level as [described
here](https://docs.chef.io/attributes.html#attribute-precedence).

# TODO
* Currently not checking for level 15 - "An automatic attribute identified by Ohai at the
start of the chef-client run"
* other versions of chef ie 12.
